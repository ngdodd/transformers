When I got home my mom was running around the house shuttling clothes from closets and drawers to open suitcases.\n\"Are we going somewhere?\" I asked, setting my car keys on the kitchen table.\nShe stopped in place and stood up, looking at me for a moment.\n\"I am,\" she started. \"I've been talking to Aunt Cathy on the phone and I don't think she's doing very well, with the divorce and then your father. I'm going to spend a few days out there with her until she's feeling better.\"\nCathy is my dad's sister and I always suspected her to be a bit batty. She didn't come from Delaware for my dad's, her brother's, funeral; said she wouldn't be able to drive herself, and nobody could pick her up.\nMy mom continued, \"Would that be alright? I mean, will you be okay by yourself for a while?\"\nShe must have noticed that I was handling things better than I had been at first. My dad died in January, it was now March. Seems like enough time to me.\n\"I'll be fine,\" I said. \"Nothing major going on, just school. Are you leaving tonight or tomorrow?\"\nNothing major.\nShe left early the next morning, before I would normally leave for school. Before she left she told me not to throw any wild teenage drug parties. I told her I wouldn't know how if I wanted to. She left, I went back to bed.\nIt's a marvelous feeling, to sleep right through the start of the school day. Skipping school is one thing, playing sick is one thing, but just not going to school is another feeling entirely. It felt like freedom. The kind of freedom that will cost you later, but at the time seems worth it."}
