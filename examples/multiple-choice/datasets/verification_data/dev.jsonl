There were plenty of open slots in the front, so she figured the guy was there for something other than a bag of chips and a coke.\nA chilly breeze blew up her mini-skirt and she shivered. She pressed her legs together tightly to generate some heat. The knee-high boots protected her feet and calves, but her butt was freezing off.\nShe wrote down the license number as she circled around to the side of the expensive vehicle. He'll have a big wad of cash, she thought.\nLarry Luzor had just stepped out of the car, when she said, \"Nice car, Honey.\"\n\"Uh, thanks.\"\n\"I'm Candy. You got a sweet tooth tonight?\"\nHe gave her the once over. Her black hair framed a pretty, young-looking face. The low-cut blouse left little to the imagination, barely hiding her nipples. She was average height, but the high heel boots elevated her to about 5'8\". The long legs were very nice.\nLarry had never used a prostitute. He'd always thought of it as revolting. The idea of having sex with a woman who'd been with hundreds of men did not appeal to him.\nBut this didn't seem like a typical hooker. She seemed too clean--almost pure. But of course, she wasn't. He knew she had to be just as skanky as the rest of them. Still--if he hadn't been in the middle of something important he might have been more than willing to buy what she was selling.\n\"So, what do you say? Want to get it on?\" She smiled seductively.\nHe was impressed that she had all her teeth, and that they looked white.\n\"How can I resist?\" He grinned at her and winked."}
