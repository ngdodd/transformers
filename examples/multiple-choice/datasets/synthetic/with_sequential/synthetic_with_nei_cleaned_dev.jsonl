{"id": "custom_12813", "context": "The work is divided into two main parts , the Rechtslehre and the Tugendlehre . Mary J. Gregor s translation ( 1991 ) explains these German terms as , respectively , The Doctrine of Right , which deals with the rights that people have or can acquire , and the Doctrine of Virtue , which deals with the virtues they ought to acquire . Rechtslehre has also been translated as the Science of Right ( Hastie ) or the Metaphysical Elements of Justice ( Ladd ) . It is grounded in republican interpretation of origins of political community as civil society and establishment of positive law . Published separately in 1797 , the Doctrine of Right is one of the last examples of classical republicanism in political philosophy . The Doctrine of Right contains the most mature of Kant s statements on the peace project and a system of law to ensure individual rights . The Doctrine of Virtue develops further Kant s ethical theory , which Kant first laid out in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ( 1785 ) . Kant particularly emphasizes treating humanity as an end in itself ; in fact the Kant s retake of the second formulation of the categorical imperative ( e.g . Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ) makes possible to deduce duties . The duties are analitically treated by Kant , who distinguishes : 1 ) duties towards ourselves ; 2 ) duties towards others . The duties are : 1 ) perfect duties ; 2 ) imperfect duties . Kant thinks imperfect duties let a latitudo : i.e. , the possibility of choose maxims .

Mark has ambitions to further his career and begins to seek connections in the county s high society . He is soon preyed upon by local Whig Member of Parliament Mr Sowerby to guarantee a substantial loan , which Mark in a moment of weakness agrees to do , even though he does not have the means and knows Sowerby to be a notorious debtor . The consequences of this blunder play a major role in the plot , with Mark eventually being publicly humiliated when bailiffs arrive and begin to take an inventory of the Robarts ' furniture . At the last moment , Lord Lufton forces a loan on the reluctant Mark . Another plot line deals with the romance between Mark s sister Lucy and Lord Lufton . The couple are deeply in love and the young man proposes , but Lady Lufton is against the marriage . She would prefer that her son instead choose the coldly beautiful Griselda Grantly , daughter of Archdeacon Grantly , and fears that Lucy is too insignificant for such a high position . Lucy herself recognises the great gulf between their social positions and declines the proposal . When Lord Lufton persists , she agrees only on condition that Lady Lufton ask her to accept her son . Lucy s conduct and charity ( especially towards the family of poor priest Josiah Crawley ) weaken her ladyship s resolve . In addition , Griselda becomes engaged to Lord Dumbello . But it is the determination of Lord Lufton that in the end vanquishes his doting mother . The book ends with Lucy and Ludovic s marriage as well as three other marriages . Two of these involve the daughters of Bishop Proudie and Archdeacon Grantly . The rivalry between Mrs Proudie and Mrs Grantly over their matrimonial ambitions forms a significant comic subplot , with the latter triumphant .

Holmes manages to extricate himself by claiming that Watson is his lover , much to the doctor s embarrassment . In the main plot , a Belgian woman , Gabrielle Valladon ( Genevive Page ) , is fished out of the River Thames and brought to Baker Street . She begs Holmes to find her missing engineer husband . The resulting investigation leads to a castle in Scotland . Along the way , they encounter a group of monks and some midgets , and Watson apparently sights the Loch Ness monster . It turns out that Sherlock s brother Mycroft ( Christopher Lee ) is involved in building a pre-World War I submarine for the British Navy , with the assistance of Monsieur Valladon . When taken out for testing , it was disguised as a sea monster . The midgets were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air . When they meet , Mycroft informs Sherlock that his client is actually a top German spy , Ilse von Hoffmanstal , sent to steal the submersible . The monks are German sailors . Queen Victoria ( Mollie Maureen ) arrives for an inspection of the new weapon , but objects to its unsportsmanlike nature . She orders the exasperated Mycroft to destroy it , so he conveniently leaves it unguarded for the monks to take ( rigging it to sink when it is submerged ) . Frulein von Hoffmanstal is arrested , to be exchanged for her British counterpart . In the final scene some months later , Sherlock receives a message from his brother , telling him that von Hoffmanstal had been arrested as a spy in Japan , and subsequently executed by firing squad .

{"id": "custom_28446", "context": "Ibn Tufail drew the name of the tale and most of its characters from an earlier work by Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) , but the plot was very different , and the book was a new and innovative work in its own right . Avicenna s story was essentially a thought experiment about the active intellect , personified by an elderly sage , instructing the narrator , who represents the human rational soul , about the nature of the universe . The plot of Ibn Tufail s more famous Arabic novel was inspired by Avicennism , Kalam and Sufism , and was also intended as a thought experiment . Ibn Tufail s novel tells the story of an autodidactic feral child , raised by a gazelle and living alone on a desert island in the Indian Ocean . After his gazelle mother passes away when he is still a child , he dissects her body and performs an autopsy in order to find out what happened to her . The discovery that her death was due to a loss of innate heat sets him on a road of scientific inquiry and self-discovery . Without contact with other human beings and solely by the exercise of his faculties , Hayy discovers ultimate truth through a systematic process of reasoned inquiry in seven phases of seven years each . Hayy ultimately comes into contact with civilization and religion when he meets a castaway named Absal . He determines that certain trappings of religion and civilization , namely imagery and dependence on material goods , are necessary for the multitude in order that they might have decent lives . However , he believes that imagery and material goods are distractions from the truth and ought to be abandoned by those whose reason recognizes that they are distractions . Ibn Tufail s book reflects one of the main concerns of Muslim philosophers , that of reconciling philosophy with revelation . At the same time , the narrative anticipates in some ways both Robinson Crusoe and Emile , or On Education . The story of Hayy Ibn Yaqzan is also similar to the later story of Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling s The Jungle Book .", "question": "Who raised the child ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["nature", "contact", "gazelle", "not enough information"], "correct_answer_id": "2"}

Tocqueville speculates on the future of democracy in the United States , discussing possible threats to democracy and possible dangers of democracy . These include his belief that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into soft despotism as well as the risk of developing a tyranny of the majority . He observes that the strong role religion played in the United States was due to its separation from the government , a separation all parties found agreeable . He contrasts this to France where there was what he perceived to be an unhealthy antagonism between democrats and the religious , which he relates to the connection between church and state . Tocqueville also outlines the possible excesses of passion for equality among men , foreshadowing the totalitarian states of the twentieth century . Insightful analysis of political society was supplemented in the second volume by description of civil society as a sphere of private and civilian affairs . Tocqueville observed that social mechanisms have paradoxes , like in what later became known as the Tocqueville effect : social frustration increases as social conditions improve . He wrote that this growing hatred of social privilege , as social conditions improve , leads to the state concentrating more power to itself .

Mere physical growing up and mastery of the bare necessities of subsistence will not suffice to reproduce the life of the group . Deliberate effort and the taking of thoughtful pains are required .

{"id": "custom_28947", "context": "Written by Alexandre Dumas , fils , ( 18241895 ) when he was 23 years old , and first published in 1848 , La Dame aux Camlias is a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author s brief love affair with a courtesan , Marie Duplessis . Set in mid-19th century France , the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier , a demimondaine , or courtesan , suffering from consumption ( tuberculosis ) , and Armand Duval , a young bourgeois . Marguerite is nicknamed la dame aux camlias ( French for the lady of the camellias ' ) because she wears a red camellia when she s menstruating and unavailable for making love and a white camelia when she is available to her lovers . Armand falls in love with Marguerite and ultimately becomes her lover . He convinces her to leave her life as a courtesan and to live with him in the countryside . This idyllic existence is interrupted by Armand s father , who , concerned with the scandal created by the illicit relationship , and fearful that it will destroy Armand s sister s chances of marriage , convinces Marguerite to leave . Up until Marguerite s death , Armand believes that she left him for another man . Marguerite s death is described as an unending agony , during which Marguerite , abandoned by everyone , regrets what might have been . The story is narrated after Marguerite s death by two male narrators , Armand and an unnamed frame narrator . Some scholars believe that Marguerite s illness and Duplessis s publicized cause of death , consumption , was a 19th-century euphemism for syphilis . Dumas , fils , is careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite , who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand , and the suffering of the two lovers , whose love is shattered by the need to conform to the morals of the times , is rendered touchingly . In contrast the Chevalier des Grieux s love for Manon in Manon Lescaut ( 1731 ) , a French novel by Abb Prvost referenced at the beginning of La Dame aux Camlias , Armand s love is for a woman who is ready to sacrifice her riches and her lifestyle for him , but who is thwarted by the arrival of Armand s father . The novel is also marked by the description of Parisian life during the 19th century and the fragile world of the courtesan .", "question": "Which French novel is mentioned ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "set", "manon lescaut", "lovers"], "correct_answer_id": "2"}

The king fears him , but can not kill him , because of the passionate loyalty of the people . The king has a plan , however : with no son of his own , he will marry his daughter Arethusa to a Spanish prince named Pharamond , and make the Spaniard his heir . Arethusa , however , is in love with Philaster , and disdains the Spaniard . Philaster reciprocates the princess s affections , and sends his page Bellario to serve her and to be their intermediary . Arethusa is able to frustrate her father s plan by exposing Pharamond s affair with Megra , a loose gentlewoman of the court ; but the Spaniard seeks revenge , by spreading reports that Arethusa is having an affair with Bellario . The passionate Philaster is deceived by the slander , and accepts it as true . During a hunt , Philaster confronts Arethusa ; the overwrought protagonist stabs the princess ( the incident that gives the play its subtitle ) . Philaster is interrupted by a passing countryman ; they fight , and both men are wounded . Philaster crawls off , and Arethusa is discovered by nobles of the court . Arethusa s and Philaster s wounds are not fatal ; both recover . Philaster is found , arrested , and sentenced to death . The king places Philaster in Arethusa s custody ; she quickly marries him , which causes the king to decree her death as well . The executions are frustrated when the rebellious citizens capture Pharamond and hold him hostage . The falsehood of Pharamond s accusation against Arethusa is exposed when Bellario is revealed to be a disguised female ( she is Eufrasia , a courtier s daughter , infatuated with Philaster ) . Pharamond retreats to Spain . Since the rightful ruler of Sicily is now the king s son and no alternative presents itself , Philaster is restored to his crown .

{"id": "custom_1710", "context": "The dramatists chose to portray only the beginning of the story of Caesar and Cleopatra in their play ; they concentrate on the events of 48 BC . The play is set in Egypt ; at its start , the Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII has sequestered his sister/wife/queen Cleopatra and has assumed sole rule of the kingdom , and the Battle of Pharsalia has not yet occurred . By the play s end , Caesar has deposed Ptolemy and placed Cleopatra in sole possession of the Egyptian crown . The play s Prologue specifically states that the work shows a virginal Young Cleopatra ... and her great Mind / Express d to the height ... . Some of the famous aspects of the story are reproduced in the play : Cleopatra has herself delivered to Caesar in Act III , though enclosed in a packet rather than rolled up in a rug . The playwrights chose to concentrate much of their attention on the figure of Lucius Septimius , the Roman officer who betrayed , murdered , and decapitated Pompey the Great when Pompey landed in Egypt after his Pharsalia defeat ( events depicted in Act II ) . Septimius is the false one of the title , and his prominence comes close to turning the work into a villain play . Yet Septimius is portrayed as lacking any redeeming or sympathetic quality , making him a weak prop on which to mount a drama . The authors ' choice in this matter may have been dictated by their desire to comment on contemporaneous political events ; in this interpretation , the Pompey of the play represents Sir Walter Raleigh , executed in 1618 , while the loathsome reprobate Septimius stands for Raleigh s primary accuser , Sir Lewis Stukeley . Critics have seen the influence of Shakespeare s Antony and Cleopatra in The False One , and have suggested that the portrayal of Septimius was partially modelled on Shakespeare s Enobarbus . The False One is heavily dominated by political material , rather than dramatic realisations of its characters ; for some critics , the split in the play s focus among Cleopatra , Caesar , and Septimius prevents the play from cohering into an effective dramatic whole .", "question": "Who does Pompey represent ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["sir walter raleigh", "focus", "not enough information", "prominence"], "correct_answer_id": "0"}

The following day , Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the pillory for one hour , followed by another hour s public exposure . He calls for water . Esmeralda , seeing his thirst , approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water . It saves him , and she captures his heart . Later , Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus , whom Frollo actually attempted to kill in jealousy after seeing him trying to seduce Esmeralda . She is sentenced to death by hanging . As she is being led to the gallows , Quasimodo swings down by the bell rope of Notre Dame and carries her off to the cathedral under the law of sanctuary , temporarily protecting her from arrest . Frollo later informs Gringoire that the Court of Parlement has voted to remove Esmeralda s right to sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be killed . Clopin , the leader of the Gypsies , hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the citizens of Paris to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda . When Quasimodo sees the Gypsies , he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda , so he drives them off . Likewise , he thinks the King s men want to rescue her , and tries to help them find her .

But after yet another failed attempt to win her love , Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is being hanged . When Frollo laughs during Esmeralda s hanging , Quasimodo pushes him from the heights of Notre Dame to his death .

With the British School of Calderonistas , this attitude changed . A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked . Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo s actions and also serves as Segismundo s guide , leading him to a final conversion . For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince .

For Frederick de Armas , Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto . When she goes to Court , she takes on the name of Astraea , the goddess of chastity and justice . Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages . Her return signals the return of a Golden Age . Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times .

The novel opens with Alan s purchase of a home in the Kensington Market neighborhood of modern-day Toronto . There are two main plotlines . Alan befriends Kurt , a thirtysomething punk who operates a dumpster-diving operation . Kurt uses computer components that he retrieves from the trash and turns them into Wi-Fi network access points . Kurt s goal is to blanket the entire neighborhood with free and secure Internet access by attaching his access points to buildings in a wireless mesh network with the permission of their owners . Kurt s plan does n't really get off the ground until he forms a partnership with Alan , who puts a more professional face on the operation and sweet-talks many local owners into allowing the access points to use their space and a small amount of their electricity . The second plotline features fantasy elements . Unbeknownst to most of the other characters , Alan and his brothers are not quite human . Their father is a mountain and their mother is a washing machine . Alan s eldest brother can see the future , his second-eldest is an island , his younger brother is undead , and his three youngest brothers are a set of Russian nesting dolls .

Outwardly , he looks human , but he heals at an incredible rate , and if part of him is cut off , it will grow back , and the cut off part can be made to form a new copy of him , much like an earthworm does .

Born with wings on her back and no family history , she lives with her abusive boyfriend Krishna , a musician/bartender who can spot beings like Alan and his family , and hates them .

The first entry , dated May 31 , 1939 , indicates that the three defendants in a case of capital murderRobert Basso , Stanley Howell , and Roy Leminghave all been declared indigent and had attorneys appointed for them . A second , dated June 12 , indicates that the trial of Basso and Howell has been severed from that of Leming , now defended by an attorney of questionable character . The defendants and their victim are all foreignersthe people from somewhere else . They have been charged with the cold-blooded murder of a drug dealer and addict , Frederick Zollicoffer , whom they had kidnapped for ransom on April 6 , and killed afterwards on or about April 17 , possibly at the direction of a fourth criminal who died in a fall trying to escape from police in New York City . The F.B.I . had also entered the case and arrested Howell , from whom they had extracted a confession.Unlike many courtoom dramas , The Just and the Unjust is selective in its actual presentation of courtoom events . Not all witnesses are presented , and testimony and arguments are incomplete . However Cozzens displays an ear for what is mundane to the reader s interest and what is germane to characterization , if not to plot . He develops two legal subplots of a sex scandal involving a local high school teacher and a vehicular homicide case involving the son of an influential politician , and weaves their storylines into the ongoing trial , allowing Cozzens to cut away from what are often tedious courtroom procedures . These legal plot lines are supported by personal complications in Abner Coates ' life , as he tries to reason out whether or not he wants to run for district attorney ( and beholden to Jesse Gearhart ) , get married , and how to deal with his infirm father .", "question": "Who has to care for an infirm father ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "germane", "testimony", "abner coates"], "correct_answer_id": "3"}

Middle-class professionals are distrusted , and the statement do n't buy from Jews causes much anxiety among Jewish people . It is reasonable to assume that the Jews will not be left in peace . Neither a change in the feelings of non-Jews nor a movement to merge into the surrounds of Europe offers much hope to the Jewish people : The Jewish question persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers .

Immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration . ( Quoted from The Jewish State , translated by Sylvie dAvigdor , Nutt , London , 1896 , and reprinted by Dover , 1988 , p . 95 . ) For that reason , Herzl , both in Der Judenstaat , and in his political activity on behalf of Zionism , concentrated his efforts on securing official legal sanction from the Ottoman authorities .", "question": "Who opposed efforts made by Zionist groups ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["zionist", "not enough information", "ghettos", "herzl"], "correct_answer_id": "3"}

The first central character , Tom Brangwen , is a farmer whose experience of the world does not stretch beyond these two counties ; while the last , Ursula , his granddaughter , studies at university and becomes a teacher in the progressively urbanised , capitalist and industrial world . The book starts with a description of the Brangwen dynasty , then deals with how Tom Brangwen , one of several brothers , fell in love with a Polish refugee and widow , Lydia . The next part of the book deals with Lydia s daughter by her first husband , Anna , and her destructive , battle-riven relationship with her husband , Will , the son of one of Tom s brothers . The last and most extended part of the book , and also probably the most famous , then deals with Will and Anna s daughter , Ursula , and her struggle to find fulfilment for her passionate , spiritual and sensual nature against the confines of the increasingly materialist and conformist society around her . She experiences a same-sex relationship with a teacher , and a passionate but ultimately doomed love affair with Anton Skrebensky , a British soldier of Polish ancestry . At the end of the book , having failed to find her fulfilment in Skrebensky , she has a vision of a rainbow towering over the Earth , promising a new dawn for humanity : She saw in the rainbow the earth s new architecture , the old , brittle corruption of houses and factories swept away , the world built up in a living fabric of Truth , fitting to the over-arching heaven .", "question": "Who fell in love with Lydia ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "tom brangwen", "britain", "industrialisation"], "correct_answer_id": "1"}

However , Sand resists the immediate happy ending of marriage between the two main characters in favor of a more gradual story of education , including a reappraisal of the passive female role in courtship and marriage . Sand also calls into question Rousseau s ideal version of the female education as described in his novel Emile , namely , training women for domesticity and the home . The novel , set before the French Revolution , depicts the coming of age of a nobleman named Bernard Mauprat . The story is narrated by the old Bernard in his country home many years later , as told to a nameless young male visitor . Bernard recounts how , raised by a violent gang of his feudal kinsmen after the death of his mother , he becomes a brutalized enfant sauvage . When his cousin Edme is held captive by Bernard s family , he helps her escape , but elicits a promise of marriage from her by threatening rape . Thus begins the long courtship of Bernard and Edme . The novel ends with a dramatic trial scene , similar to that in Stendhal s The Red and the Black . During the period Sand wrote the novel , she was gradually becoming more interested in the problem of political equality in society . She had read widely about the views of socialist thinkers such as Pierre Leroux , with whom she went on to form a journal , the Revue Indpendante .

{"id": "custom_1590", "context": "Following a delinquent childhood and youth , Davies renounced his home and his apprenticeship with a frame-maker . At the age of twenty-two , having borrowed money from the executor of his grandmothers estate , he sailed to America . This was the first of more than a dozen Atlantic crossings , often made by working his passage aboard a cattle boat . Between 1893 and 1899 Davies travelled the highways and railroads , tutored by hardened men of the road . He took advantage of the corrupt system of boodle jails in order to pass the winter in Michigan , staying a series of different jails . These were jails in which a tramp could make an illicit arrangement with a law enforcement officer to stay in the jail without being an actual prisoner . Here , with his fellow tramps , Davies would enjoy the relative comfort of card-playing , singing , smoking , reading , relating experiences and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk . Regular work was never an option and Davies subsisted largely by begging . After crossing the Atlantic one last time , from Britain to Canada , at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush , Davies fell while hopping a train . His foot was crushed and his leg had to be amputated below the knee . He later wrote of the effect the accident had on his life : All the wildness had been taken out of me and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking . The book was praised by Osbert Sitwell for its primitive splendour and directness , while Bernard Shaw himself commended the prose to literary experts for its style alone , describing Davies as the incorrigible Supertramp who wrote this amazing book .", "question": "Which gold rush was mentioned in the story ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "highways", "klondike gold rush", "tramp"], "correct_answer_id": "2"}

Dewey observes that even in a savage tribe , the achievements of adults are far beyond what the immature members would be capable of if left to themselves . With the growth of civilization , the gap between the original capacities of the immature and the standards and customs of the elders increases . Mere physical growing up and mastery of the bare necessities of subsistence will not suffice to reproduce the life of the group . Deliberate effort and the taking of thoughtful pains are required .

It is now opening night of his latest effort , and all around him assure him that this one will be the best yet . But as opening hour approaches , Rogan falls prey to doubts and fears , egged on by another playwright whose last work was trashed by the local newspaper s new drama critic , Steven Schwimmer . He eventually lets those fears drive him to adopt a resolve to kill the critic ( who he assumes will also trash his play ) , and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed . Instead of attending the play s opening night Rogan spends the time in a bar , accompanied by a lady cab driver and her grandson ; earlier in the evening the lady misidentified Rogan as a local small-time hoodlum , and Rogan does not correct her misidentification . They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets . The Sox had won 3 games and could clinch the title by winning Game 6 , but Rogan , a lifelong Sox fan , knows how easily they can lose when they should win . He spends the evening waiting for the inevitable , even though the Sox are ahead most of the time . When the inevitable does occur ( due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end of the final inning ) , he snaps , and heads out to take out his rage on the newspaper critic . He not only finds the critic , but finds him in the early stages of deflowering the playwright s daughter .

{"id": "custom_5768", "context": "The play is set in a fictionalised version of the Kingdom of Sicily , ruled by an otherwise-unnamed king . This king s father and predecessor , the ruler of Southern Italy ( the Kingdom of Naples ) , had conquered the island of Sicily and displaced the native royal house ; but the heir of that house , and rightful king of Sicily , is Philaster , who lives as a nobleman in the royal court . The king fears him , but can not kill him , because of the passionate loyalty of the people . The king has a plan , however : with no son of his own , he will marry his daughter Arethusa to a Spanish prince named Pharamond , and make the Spaniard his heir . Arethusa , however , is in love with Philaster , and disdains the Spaniard . Philaster reciprocates the princess s affections , and sends his page Bellario to serve her and to be their intermediary . Arethusa is able to frustrate her father s plan by exposing Pharamond s affair with Megra , a loose gentlewoman of the court ; but the Spaniard seeks revenge , by spreading reports that Arethusa is having an affair with Bellario . The passionate Philaster is deceived by the slander , and accepts it as true . During a hunt , Philaster confronts Arethusa ; the overwrought protagonist stabs the princess ( the incident that gives the play its subtitle ) . Philaster is interrupted by a passing countryman ; they fight , and both men are wounded . Philaster crawls off , and Arethusa is discovered by nobles of the court . Arethusa s and Philaster s wounds are not fatal ; both recover . Philaster is found , arrested , and sentenced to death . The king places Philaster in Arethusa s custody ; she quickly marries him , which causes the king to decree her death as well . The executions are frustrated when the rebellious citizens capture Pharamond and hold him hostage . The falsehood of Pharamond s accusation against Arethusa is exposed when Bellario is revealed to be a disguised female ( she is Eufrasia , a courtier s daughter , infatuated with Philaster ) . Pharamond retreats to Spain . Since the rightful ruler of Sicily is now the king s son and no alternative presents itself , Philaster is restored to his crown .

On his journey , Strether stops in England , and there meets Maria Gostrey , an American woman who has lived in Paris for years . Her cynical wit and worldly opinions start to rattle Strether s preconceived view of the situation . In Paris , Strether meets Chad , and is impressed by the much greater sophistication Chad seems to have gained during his years in Europe . Chad takes him to a garden party , where Strether meets Marie de Vionnet , a lovely woman of impeccable manners , separated from her reportedly unpleasant husband , and Jeanne , her exquisite daughter . Strether is confused as to whether Chad is more attracted to the mother or the daughter . At the same time , Strether , himself , feels an overwhelming attraction to Marie de Vionnet , which he suspects she might requite , and so begins questioning his commitment to return to Woollett and marry Chad s mother , despite his admiration for her . All of these impressions of Parisian culture lead Strether to confide in Little Bilham , a friend of Chad s , that he might have missed the best life has to offer ; he starts to delight in the loveliness of Paris , and stops Chad from returning to America . Strether s American traveling companion , Waymarsh , provides thematic counterpoint , by refusing to be seduced by the charms of Europe . Meanwhile , Mrs. Newsome , Strether s fiance and Chad s mother , impatiently waiting in America , enlists new ambassadors to return forthwith with Chad . The most important of the new ambassadors , Sarah Pocock , Chad s sister , harshly dismisses Strether s impression that Chad has improved , condemns Marie as an indecent woman , and demands that Chad immediately return to the family business in America . To escape his troubles , Strether takes a brief tour of the French countryside , and accidentally encounters Chad and Marie at a rural inn ; he then comprehends the full extent of their romance . After returning to Paris , he counsels Chad not to leave Marie ; but Strether finds he is now uncomfortable in Europe .

Queen Flavia , dutifully but unhappily married to her cousin Rudolf V , writes to her true love Rudolf Rassendyll . The letter is carried by von Tarlenheim to be delivered by hand , but it is stolen by the exiled Rupert of Hentzau , who sees in it a chance to return to favour by informing the pathologically jealous and paranoid King . Rassendyll returns to Ruritania to aid the Queen , but is once more forced to impersonate the King after Rupert shoots Rudolf V. In turn , Rassendyll kills Rupert , but is assassinated in the hour of triumph by one of Rupert s henchmenand thus is spared the crisis of conscience over whether or not to continue the royal deception for years .

While Mary s cousin , Elizabeth , hesitates over signing Mary s death sentence , Mary hopes for a reprieve . After Mary finds out that Mortimer ( created by Schiller ) , the nephew of her custodian , is on her side , she entrusts her life to him . Mortimer is supposed to give Robert Dudley , the Earl of Leicester , a letter from Mary , in which she pleads for help . This is a delicate situation , for Leicester seems to support Queen Elizabeth . After numerous requests , Mary finally gains the opportunity to meet Queen Elizabeth ( something that , in reality , never happened ) . This meeting ends in an acrimonious argument , caused by Mary s unwillingness to submit entirely to Elizabeth s wish . The argument leads to the inevitable suspicion that the cause of reprieve will not succeed . To complicate matters further , Mortimer plans to free Mary from the prison by force , a dramatized version of the unsuccessful Babington Plot , but when his attempt is found out , he commits suicide . Queen Elizabeth eventually persuades herself to sign Mary s death warrant . Elizabeth insists that her only reason for signing is the pressure from her own people to do so . The signed warrant is handed to Queen Elizabeth s undersecretary Davison without any clear instructions on what to do with it . In the process , Elizabeth transfers the burden of responsibility to him , fully aware that he in turn will hand over the warrant to Lord Burleigh , and thus confirm Mary s death sentence . Burleigh demands the signed document from Davison , who  despite his uncertainty  eventually hands it to him . As a result , Burleigh has Mary executed . The play ends with Elizabeth blaming both Burleigh and Davison for Mary s death ( banishing the former from court and having the latter imprisoned in the Tower ) , Lord Shrewsbury ( who pleaded for mercy for Mary throughout the play ) resigning his honors and Leicester leaving England for France .
