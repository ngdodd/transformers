{"id": "custom_19982", "context": "The play loosely follows the life of Joan of Arc . It contains a prologue introducing the important characters , followed by five acts . Each dramatizes a significant event in Joan s life . Down into Act IV the play departs from history in only secondary details ( e.g . by making Joan kill people in battle , and by shifting the reconciliation between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians from 1435 to 1430 ) . Thereafter , however , the plot is entirely free . Joan is about to kill an English knight when , on removing his helmet , she at once falls in love with him , and spares him . Blaming herself for what she regards as a betrayal of her mission , then , when at Reims she is publicly accused of sorcery , she refuses to defend herself , is assumed to be guilty , and dismissed from the French court and army . Captured by the English , she witnesses from her prison cell a battle in which the French are being decisively defeated , breaks her bonds , and dashes out to save the day . She dies as victory is won , her honour and her reputation both restored . The play reflects the new nationalism and militarism of the budding nineteenth century , and also the Kantian ideal of the need to subject emotion to moral principle . The line Mit der Dummheit kmpfen Gtter selbst vergebens ( III , 6 ; Talbot ) translates into English as Against stupidity , the gods themselves contend in vain . This provided Isaac Asimov with the title of his novel The Gods Themselves . This was the most performed ( at least in Germany ) of all Schiller s plays down to the Great War . In modern post-war Germany , its militarism is an embarrassment , but the dramatic power of the last two acts keeps the play on the stage .", "question": "Who does Joan fall in love with ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "people", "english", "prologue"], "correct_answer_id": "2"}

{"id": "custom_11920", "context": "The work is divided into two main parts , the Rechtslehre and the Tugendlehre . Mary J. Gregor s translation ( 1991 ) explains these German terms as , respectively , The Doctrine of Right , which deals with the rights that people have or can acquire , and the Doctrine of Virtue , which deals with the virtues they ought to acquire . Rechtslehre has also been translated as the Science of Right ( Hastie ) or the Metaphysical Elements of Justice ( Ladd ) . It is grounded in republican interpretation of origins of political community as civil society and establishment of positive law . Published separately in 1797 , the Doctrine of Right is one of the last examples of classical republicanism in political philosophy . The Doctrine of Right contains the most mature of Kant s statements on the peace project and a system of law to ensure individual rights . The Doctrine of Virtue develops further Kant s ethical theory , which Kant first laid out in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ( 1785 ) . Kant particularly emphasizes treating humanity as an end in itself ; in fact the Kant s retake of the second formulation of the categorical imperative ( e.g . Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ) makes possible to deduce duties . The duties are analitically treated by Kant , who distinguishes : 1 ) duties towards ourselves ; 2 ) duties towards others . The duties are : 1 ) perfect duties ; 2 ) imperfect duties . Kant thinks imperfect duties let a latitudo : i.e. , the possibility of choose maxims .

His mother dies soon after giving birth and his father is driven mad with grief . Random s paternal grandfather coerces a local school master into providing free education for the boy , who becomes popular with his classmates ( some of whom he encounters again in subsequent adventures ) and learns Latin , French , Italian and ancient Greek . The language accomplishments are despite , rather than because of , the abusive tutor who oppresses Random at every opportunity . Finally Random is cast out after the tutor exacts revenge for one of Random s escapades and denounces him to his grandfather . With none of his paternal family willing to assist him in any way , Random relies on his wits and the occasional support of his maternal uncle , Tom Bowling . The naive Random then embarks on a series of adventures and misadventures , visiting inter alia : London , Bath , France , the West Indies , West Africa and South America . With little money to support himself , he encounters malice , discrimination and sharpers at every turn . His honest and trustworthy character and medical skills do however win him a few staunch friends . Roderick spends much of the novel trying to attract the attention of various wealthy women he meets , so that he can live comfortably and take up his rightful entitlement as a gentleman . To that end he poses as a nobleman several times , including once while he is in France . Roderick and his companion Hugh Strap end up serving twice on British ships , once on a privateer and once on a warship after being press-ganged .

To the former he attributes the adjectives legal or submissive , passive , and oriental , and to the latter the adjectives legislative , creative , organizing , or masterful , and active , calling it a more modern and much less abundant type of mind . Observing that these two minds reach divergent and incompatible consequences in the spheres of morality and public affairs , Wells analyzes the reasons for which the past-oriented mind predominates and asserts that this is principally due to the evidently greater knowability of the personal past as compared to the future . But he argues that the inference from this attitude that the future is essentially unknowable does not square with modern science , that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of phenomena . Not only has science made us knowledgeable about a distant , impersonal past , it also regards the ability successfully to predict to be a criterion of validity . Though the unpredictability of human behavior complicates the problem , the fact that as individuals increase in number they begin to average out means that an inductive knowledge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility . Confessing himself to be among those who believe entirely in the forces behind the individual rather than in individuals themselves as determining causes , Wells argues that there is no reason why we should not aspire to , and discover and use , safe and servicable , generalizations upon countless issues in the human destiny . But personal prophecy and fortune-telling will never be possible ; the knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not individual . Wells devotes the last part of his text to speculations about the question what is to come after man , considering it the most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole world . He concludes with a statement of personal faith in the coherency and purpose in the world and in the greatness of human destiny .", "question": "Which part of human behavior complicates the problem ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["mind .", "past", "minds", "not enough information"], "correct_answer_id": "0"}

Avicenna s story was essentially a thought experiment about the active intellect , personified by an elderly sage , instructing the narrator , who represents the human rational soul , about the nature of the universe . The plot of Ibn Tufail s more famous Arabic novel was inspired by Avicennism , Kalam and Sufism , and was also intended as a thought experiment . Ibn Tufail s novel tells the story of an autodidactic feral child , raised by a gazelle and living alone on a desert island in the Indian Ocean . After his gazelle mother passes away when he is still a child , he dissects her body and performs an autopsy in order to find out what happened to her . The discovery that her death was due to a loss of innate heat sets him on a road of scientific inquiry and self-discovery . Without contact with other human beings and solely by the exercise of his faculties , Hayy discovers ultimate truth through a systematic process of reasoned inquiry in seven phases of seven years each . Hayy ultimately comes into contact with civilization and religion when he meets a castaway named Absal . He determines that certain trappings of religion and civilization , namely imagery and dependence on material goods , are necessary for the multitude in order that they might have decent lives . However , he believes that imagery and material goods are distractions from the truth and ought to be abandoned by those whose reason recognizes that they are distractions . Ibn Tufail s book reflects one of the main concerns of Muslim philosophers , that of reconciling philosophy with revelation . At the same time , the narrative anticipates in some ways both Robinson Crusoe and Emile , or On Education . The story of Hayy Ibn Yaqzan is also similar to the later story of Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling s The Jungle Book .", "question": "Who performs an autopsy on the dead gazelle ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "ibn tufail", "jungle", "discovery"], "correct_answer_id": "1"}

Philip Penniloe his approval of the match should the girl herself care for the doctor . On the very night of the squires funeral it is found that the grave has been rifled and the body stolen . The only man with a clue to the mystery is a blacksmith who has been called up late at night by a mysterious party with a cart .

Dewey observes that even in a savage tribe , the achievements of adults are far beyond what the immature members would be capable of if left to themselves . With the growth of civilization , the gap between the original capacities of the immature and the standards and customs of the elders increases . Mere physical growing up and mastery of the bare necessities of subsistence will not suffice to reproduce the life of the group . Deliberate effort and the taking of thoughtful pains are required .

{"id": "custom_18706", "context": "Wells begins by distinguishing between two divergent types of mind , one that judges and attaches importance principally to what has happened in the past and one that judges and attaches importance principally to what will happen in the future . To the former he attributes the adjectives legal or submissive , passive , and oriental , and to the latter the adjectives legislative , creative , organizing , or masterful , and active , calling it a more modern and much less abundant type of mind . Observing that these two minds reach divergent and incompatible consequences in the spheres of morality and public affairs , Wells analyzes the reasons for which the past-oriented mind predominates and asserts that this is principally due to the evidently greater knowability of the personal past as compared to the future . But he argues that the inference from this attitude that the future is essentially unknowable does not square with modern science , that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of phenomena . Not only has science made us knowledgeable about a distant , impersonal past , it also regards the ability successfully to predict to be a criterion of validity . Though the unpredictability of human behavior complicates the problem , the fact that as individuals increase in number they begin to average out means that an inductive knowledge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility . Confessing himself to be among those who believe entirely in the forces behind the individual rather than in individuals themselves as determining causes , Wells argues that there is no reason why we should not aspire to , and discover and use , safe and servicable , generalizations upon countless issues in the human destiny . But personal prophecy and fortune-telling will never be possible ; the knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not individual . Wells devotes the last part of his text to speculations about the question what is to come after man , considering it the most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole world . He concludes with a statement of personal faith in the coherency and purpose in the world and in the greatness of human destiny .", "question": "Which two factors are not possible ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["not enough information", "personal prophecy and", "morality", "criterion"], "correct_answer_id": "1"}

{"id": "custom_21288", "context": "The dramatists chose to portray only the beginning of the story of Caesar and Cleopatra in their play ; they concentrate on the events of 48 BC . The play is set in Egypt ; at its start , the Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII has sequestered his sister/wife/queen Cleopatra and has assumed sole rule of the kingdom , and the Battle of Pharsalia has not yet occurred . By the play s end , Caesar has deposed Ptolemy and placed Cleopatra in sole possession of the Egyptian crown . The play s Prologue specifically states that the work shows a virginal Young Cleopatra ... and her great Mind / Express d to the height ... . Some of the famous aspects of the story are reproduced in the play : Cleopatra has herself delivered to Caesar in Act III , though enclosed in a packet rather than rolled up in a rug . The playwrights chose to concentrate much of their attention on the figure of Lucius Septimius , the Roman officer who betrayed , murdered , and decapitated Pompey the Great when Pompey landed in Egypt after his Pharsalia defeat ( events depicted in Act II ) . Septimius is the false one of the title , and his prominence comes close to turning the work into a villain play . Yet Septimius is portrayed as lacking any redeeming or sympathetic quality , making him a weak prop on which to mount a drama . The authors ' choice in this matter may have been dictated by their desire to comment on contemporaneous political events ; in this interpretation , the Pompey of the play represents Sir Walter Raleigh , executed in 1618 , while the loathsome reprobate Septimius stands for Raleigh s primary accuser , Sir Lewis Stukeley . Critics have seen the influence of Shakespeare s Antony and Cleopatra in The False One , and have suggested that the portrayal of Septimius was partially modelled on Shakespeare s Enobarbus . The False One is heavily dominated by political material , rather than dramatic realisations of its characters ; for some critics , the split in the play s focus among Cleopatra , Caesar , and Septimius prevents the play from cohering into an effective dramatic whole .", "question": "Who rules Egypt during this time ?", "question_type": "Character_identity", "answers": ["ptolemy xiii", "drama", "one", "not enough information"], "correct_answer_id": "0"}

Upon discovery that the Fuzzies ' intelligence may qualify them as a sapient species , the Company intervenes against them , on grounds that such a discovery would declare the planet a protected aboriginal zone , and deprive the Chartered Zarathustra Company of rights to the resources there . Leonard Kellogg , one of Grego s staff , kills a Fuzzy and thus provokes a court case to decide whether the Fuzzies are sapient . In the midst of the proceedings , the Terran Navy commander reveals that his people have been studying Fuzzies , and prove that Fuzzies have at least the mental capacity of a ten-year-old human child . At once , the Charter of the Zarathustra Company is invalidated , and Kellogg commits suicide in his cell . The second book , Fuzzy Sapiens , deals with the newly Charterless Zarathustra Company ' and its gradual cooperation with the planet s new governor to ensure control over the planet , while the Fuzzies attach themselves to individual human guardians including the Company s staff . It becomes clear that criminals are using the irregular status of the government and of the company to attack it and steal sunstones . The third book , Fuzzy Bones by William Tuning , suggests that the remarkable demand by all Fuzzies for the ration-pack Extraterrestrial Type Three ' ( aka Extee 3 ' or estefee ' ) does not coincide with the composition of Zarathustran soil . A third significant Fuzzy character is developed called Starwatcher . Little Fuzzy , Diamond , and Starwatcher become the clear leaders in working with humans .

Thereafter , however , the plot is entirely free . Joan is about to kill an English knight when , on removing his helmet , she at once falls in love with him , and spares him .

She dies as victory is won , her honour and her reputation both restored . The play reflects the new nationalism and militarism of the budding nineteenth century , and also the Kantian ideal of the need to subject emotion to moral principle . The line Mit der Dummheit kmpfen Gtter selbst vergebens ( III , 6 ; Talbot ) translates into English as Against stupidity , the gods themselves contend in vain .

Her second client is decidedly more exciting : her stepfather Martin ( Alec Baldwin ) . Martin is initially shocked when he learns of her identity ( he initially blindfolded himself during intercourse as per Mini s request ) , but soon a torrid love affair blossoms between the two . In order to be together , Mini and Martin concoct a plan to have Mini s mother Diane ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) declared insane . When their plan fails , Mini convinces Martin to murder Diane , despite his initial resistance to the idea . They attempt to make it appear that Diane committed suicide , but they soon attract the attention of a detective ( Luke Wilson ) who believes that Mini and Martin killed her . A nosy neighbor , Mike ( Jeff Goldblum ) , is sexually obsessed with Mini , and when Martin learns that Mini had gone to Mike s house and had received sexual pictures from him , he and Mike get into a fight . Mini arrives to find Martin standing over the neighbor , ready to beat him into unconsciousness , and when the police arrive they arrest Martin .

During his first day in residence the eccentric Smith creates the High Court of Beacon ; arranges to elope with Mary Gray , paid companion to heiress Rosamund Hunt ; inspires Inglewood to declare his love for Diana Duke , the landlady s niece ; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist Michael Moon and Rosamund . However , when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news : Smith is wanted on charges of burglary , desertion of a spouse , polygamy , and attempted murder . The fact that Smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at Inglewood s friend Dr. Herbert Warner seems to confirm the worst . Before Smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum , Michael Moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the High Court of Beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press . The second part , The Explanations of Innocent Smith , follows the trial . The prosecution consists of Moses Gould , a merrily cynical Jew who lives at Beacon House and considers Smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel , and Dr. Cyrus Pym , an American criminal specialist called in by Dr. Warner ; Michael Moon and Arthur Inglewood act for the defence . The evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against Smith . In every case , the defendant is revealed to be , as his first name states , innocent . He fires bullets near people to make them value life ; the house he breaks into is his own ; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family ; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife Mary , posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re-enact their courtship .

Pascal has developed a serum he hopes will cure hereditary and nervous diseases ( including consumption ) and improve if not prolong life .

The king has a plan , however : with no son of his own , he will marry his daughter Arethusa to a Spanish prince named Pharamond , and make the Spaniard his heir . Arethusa , however , is in love with Philaster , and disdains the Spaniard . Philaster reciprocates the princess s affections , and sends his page Bellario to serve her and to be their intermediary . Arethusa is able to frustrate her father s plan by exposing Pharamond s affair with Megra , a loose gentlewoman of the court ; but the Spaniard seeks revenge , by spreading reports that Arethusa is having an affair with Bellario .

During his first day in residence the eccentric Smith creates the High Court of Beacon ; arranges to elope with Mary Gray , paid companion to heiress Rosamund Hunt ; inspires Inglewood to declare his love for Diana Duke , the landlady s niece ; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist Michael Moon and Rosamund . However , when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news : Smith is wanted on charges of burglary , desertion of a spouse , polygamy , and attempted murder . The fact that Smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at Inglewood s friend Dr. Herbert Warner seems to confirm the worst . Before Smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum , Michael Moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the High Court of Beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press . The second part , The Explanations of Innocent Smith , follows the trial . The prosecution consists of Moses Gould , a merrily cynical Jew who lives at Beacon House and considers Smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel , and Dr. Cyrus Pym , an American criminal specialist called in by Dr. Warner ; Michael Moon and Arthur Inglewood act for the defence . The evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against Smith . In every case , the defendant is revealed to be , as his first name states , innocent . He fires bullets near people to make them value life ; the house he breaks into is his own ; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family ; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife Mary , posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re-enact their courtship .
